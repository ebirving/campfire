# Campfire

## A collaborative storywriting app

Campfire is designed to evoke the minimalist composition editors that have been growing in popularity for desktop and native mobile environments. More specifically, Campfire blends elements of the classic improv/storytelling/time-passing game in which participants build a story one word at a time, taking turns to develop a narrative that often ends up being silly, surprising, or both.

The "game" logic is still being developed, but the current iteration of the app allows users to:
- Log in
- Contribute to the current story on word at a time
- Share the writing space with other users
- View the story archive
- Delete stories from the archive
- Enter "sprint mode", in which a story in progress is automatically saved and the writing space in cleared after 3 minutes have elapsed.

Campfire is currently a pure Meteor application. Going forward, however, I would like to implement an Angular front end. Angular's more robust templating capabilities will provide a wider range of structured options for allowing users to interact with the story canvas on a word-by-word basis.
